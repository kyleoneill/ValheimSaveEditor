# Valheim Save Editor

This WPF application edits save data for the video game [Valheim](https://www.valheimgame.com/). A save file can be opened by clicking on `File` in the app's menu and then choosing a save file in the popup dialog.

When overwriting a file, the program will make a backup of the file being overwritten.
